EGD PROCEDURE : There was nothing precluding endoscopy on history or physical 
exam. Informed consent was obtained with risks and benefits explained to the patient. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications The 
patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. The Olympus endoscope was 
inserted into the esophagus under direct visualization. It was advanced through the 
esophagus, into the stomach and through the pylorus to the duodenal bulb and 2nd 
portion of the duodenum. Careful inspection was made as the endoscope was removed 
including retroflexion in the stomach. Findings- In the distal esophagus there was an 
irregular Z-line from 38-39 cm suggestive of Barrett's esophagus. This was examined 
both white light and narrow band imaging. Biopsies were obtained of the distal 
esophagus. In the stomach there was mild antral and body gastritis. Biopsies were 
obtained for H.pylori. There were no ulcers or masses seen. The visualized portion of the 
duodenal appeared normal without ulcers or inflammation. IMPRESSION : The patient 
is 55-year-old male with atypical chest pain and right upper quadrant pain. Biopsies 
today were obtained for H.pylori and Barrett's esophagus. If the patient does Barrett's 
esophagus and a repeat EGD with biopsy in 6 months will be recommended. 
Post Operative Impression 
EGD The patient tolerated the procedure without complications. The EGD was 
uneventful.
